## 🎯 Mission Control
Turning algorithm novices into interview-slaying code warriors, one problem at a time. This isn't your grandpa's data structures course - this is a high-octane, no-nonsense route to crushing coding interviews.

## 🛠 Tech Arsenal
- **Language** - Python (because we're not here to play around)
- **Dependency Management** - Poetry (keeping our dependencies as clean as our code)
- **Testing** - Pytest (because we're not savages)
- **Goal** - Transform from "What's an algorithm?" to "Watch me solve this in O(log n)"

## 🧠 What's Inside This Code Gymnasium?
- Implementations that are more organized than your sock drawer
- Problem solutions sharper than a Silicon Valley startup pitch
- Algorithmic patterns that'll make F.A.A.N.G recruiters weep tears of joy

## 🔧 Setup: From Zero to Hero
```bash
# Clone the repo (duh!)
git clone https://github.com/sanmoh-hombal/hack-track.git

# Summon Poetry (our dependency wizard)
poetry install

# Run tests and watch the magic happen
poetry run pytest
```

## 💡 Philosophy
We don't just teach algorithms. We craft weapon-grade problem-solving skills that turn coding interviews into your personal playground.

## 🏆 Achievements Unlocked
- ✅ Demystify Data Structures
- ✅ Master Algorithmic Patterns
- ✅ Transform into an Interview Terminator

## 🤝 Contribute or Get Out!
Found a sick optimization? A mind-blowing solution? PRs are not just welcome, they're mandatory.
